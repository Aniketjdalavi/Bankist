# Bankist

Bankist is a fictitious and minimalistic online banking application that allows the user to:

Log in with a username and password
View and sort their monetary movements
Transfer money to another account
Request a loan from the bank
Delete their account
Log in credentials:

username: ad | password: 1111
username: vd | password 2222
username : ay | password 3333
Bugs that still need to be fixed:

sorting transactions
